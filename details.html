    <h2>More Details</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the second page of my personal website!  Here, I will go into my previously described passion in more detail.  
        As mentioned, I always had a passion for boats, but never owned one myself.  I was extremely lucky to have friends that had 
        boats, which made it possible for me to experience such a cool thing at a younger age than most, and this is also what 
        led to me developing this passion in the first place.  <br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way 
        Freedom Boat Club operates is similar to a “country club.”  
        Customers can pay a monthly membership fee and in return, they can reserve our boats for free, and they only pay for the gas 
        that they use.  Therefore, our company owns fleets of boats, and it is our job to maintain them, gas them up, clean them, 
        and ensure they are operating properly.  There happens to be Freedom locations all over the Boston area – Charlestown, Hingham, 
        Quincy, Plymouth, and Scituate just to name a few, so I had the opportunity to take boats all around Boston Harbor for employee duties. 
         As I’m sure you could imagine, this was very similar to my previous job at a restaurant when it came to customer service skills. 
          Dealing with customers, especially unhappy customers, is a very important skill, and while it was a much different customer-base
           at the boat club, there were a lot of similarities there.</p>

            window.location.href = 'index.html'
        })
    </script>
