        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello!  My name is John Kraunelis and I am a fourth year Computer Science and Finance Major at Northeastern University.  
            I am from Braintree, MA and currently reside on Mission Hill, not far from Northeastern's campus.  
            I originally wanted to write about my passion for the financial markets but I decided to go with something a little 
            more extracurricular.  Growing up by the ocean I always had a keen interest in fishing, swimming, and all things revolving 
            around the water.  I had always loved boats, but never had the chance to own one.  However, after a few years working at a 
            restaurant during high school, I transitioned to another job in Boston at Freedom Boat Club.  At this job, I was able to work on 
            boats by cleaning them, fixing them, and taking trips to the gas dock to ensure they were always on a full tank!  
            <br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this job, I was able to get paid for doing 
            something that I was passionate about.  
            I met a lot of really awesome people here, but also learned a lot of valuable technical expertise about boats.  
            After several years of working here, I made the ultimate decision that I would eventually buy a boat for myself one day!</p>
